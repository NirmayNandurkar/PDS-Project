    <h2 class="heading2">INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <div>
        Our team has created a game design in which we have tried to recreate one of our childhood's favourite memory Contra. The following project required various concepts of C-language and SDL library. Through this project we have made an attempt to try something new which required learning a new concept that could help us in future.
